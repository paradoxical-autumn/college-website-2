            <p>Heya! I'm autumn, aka paradoxical autumn or paradox or justAnotherParadox... the pseudonyms continue. I'm
                a programmer and (failing) musician from the UK. Outside of that? Not much, just someone who's enjoying
                life.</p>
            <p>Outside of those two things I enjoy photography, drawing, 3D animating, graphics design and finding new
                things to create.</p>
            <p>Ever since a young person, I've been fascinated by the digital world mainly thanks to unrestricted
                internet access. Oh goodness, but it helped to turn me into the person I am today.</p>
            <p>My love of music started even before that. Apparently, when I was probably 2 I was dancing to the anthems
                of the time and trying my best to create music with whatever I could find. Maybe when I was about 7, my
                dad had introduced me to an old and longforgotten app called "launchpad" (I think that was the name)
                which allowed me to create quick loops of music using premade samples. By the time I was 10, I was
                messing with the demo for FL Studio and, well... not getting very far as I wasn't allowed to download
                random files onto the family computer. Y'know, random files includes virtual instruments so I was
                basically stuck with the default set in FL at the time.</p>
            <h1 id="education">Education</h1>
            <p>I had a fairly normal education. I wont go into detail about most of it, but only the things that
                influenced me the most.</p>
            <p>While I was in year 3 (or 2nd grade for you americans out there) my school introduced me to a piece of
                software called <i>Scratch</i>, you might've heard of it. It allows you to create simple games using
                building blocks of code in a visual way and man, I was HOOKED. I don't remember what I created but I
                know that I made a <i>lot.</i>
                It even got to a point where my parents sent me to a (single) dedicated class about scratch where we
                made my most ambitious project yet, a (fairly simple) game where you're a shark trying to catch fish.
                Sounds simple, but bear in mind I was probably 7 when I was creating this.
            </p>
            <p>It was also about this time that I was taking guitar lessons as a pass-time but nothing ever came from
                those. It only showed my passion for music, but I think that was emphasised by my love of music class.
            </p>
            <p>...then came</p>
            <h2>Secondary Education</h2>
            <p><i>"Man, primary school was amazing! I wonder how much I'll like secondary??" ~ a foolish me</i></p>
            <p>Secondary school for me was... difficult, but this isn't about that. I'm just glad I survived it, anyway.
                During year 8 I was taught a very basic version of python and I was amazed by what I could do. It
                started with a simple project to ask a user for their name and age and echo it back to them. Pretty
                simple.
            </p>
            <p><i>...i did not keep it simple.</i></p>
            <p>I realised that if you entered text during the age input, the program would crash due to incompatible
                types. So... I made it my goal to prevent that. I then found out about exception handling and looping,
                even before the teacher taught the rest of the class. <i>Fun fact: I was never taught exception handling
                    officially.</i>
            </p>
            <p>The teacher was (or at least acted) shocked that I managed to do this from a simple introduction where
                the most code we were expected to write was:
            </p>
            <pre>
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age))</pre>
            <p>...and yet I wrote something more like this:</p>
            <pre>
name = input("What's your name?\n> ")
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("How old are you?\n> "))
        break
    except TypeError:
        print("That's not a number!!")

print(f"Heya, {name}!! You're {age} but I don't know why I'd need to know that.")
</pre>
            <p class="subtext"><i>in case you couldn't tell, my <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/irreverence"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-hypr">irreverence</a> has been with me
                    from a young
                    age.</i></p>
            <p>and again, remember this was my first time writing python code!
                Anyway, not much happened beyond that point except that I also learnt SQL (thanks AQA) and actually used
                it in a project at the time - <a class="content-hypr"

                    rel="noreferrer noopener">Quoter</a> - and I say I used it pretty decently!
