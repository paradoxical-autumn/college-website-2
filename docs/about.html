            <p>Heya! I'm autumn, aka paradoxical autumn or paradox or justAnotherParadox... the pseudonyms continue. I'm
                a programmer and (failing) musician from the UK. Outside of that? Not much, just someone who's enjoying
                life.</p>
            <p>Outside of those two things I enjoy photography, drawing, 3D animating, graphics design and finding new
                things to create.</p>
            <p>Ever since a young person, I've been fascinated by the digital world mainly thanks to unrestricted
                internet access. Oh goodness, but it helped to turn me into the person I am today.</p>
            <p>My love of music started even before that. Apparently, when I was probably 2 I was dancing to the anthems
                of the time and trying my best to create music with whatever I could find. Maybe when I was about 7, my
                dad had introduced me to an old and longforgotten app called "launchpad" (I think that was the name)
                which allowed me to create quick loops of music using premade samples. By the time I was 10, I was
                messing with the demo for FL Studio and, well... not getting very far as I wasn't allowed to download
                random files onto the family computer. Y'know, random files includes virtual instruments so I was
                basically stuck with the default set in FL at the time.</p>
            <h1 id="education">Education</h1>
            <p>I had a fairly normal education. I wont go into detail about most of it, but only the things that
                influenced me the most.</p>
